usage: allClasses [src]

	Generates a main application class containing imports for all classes
	within a src directory (called 'AllClasses.hx').
	
	This command traverses the packages within the src directory to find the
	deepest unique package to generate the file in.
	
	If no src directory path is specified, this command will run against
	the 'src' resource types within the project's .mlib settings file.
	(see 'mlib help config' for more details)
	
Optional parameters:

   [src]   : Relative or absolute path to a src directory. If not set will use defaults
             specified within the project's .mlib settings.
